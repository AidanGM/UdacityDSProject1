# UdacityDSProject1
## Udacity data science nanodegree project 1 - looking at Boston Airbnb datasets

Within this project the CRISP-DM process is applied to gain an understanding of the Boston Airbnb market and answer some business questions. The motivation behind this project had multiple components, beyond better understanding how Airbnbs work and are priced using Boston as an example. It has build my skills in data wrangling, visualisation and analysis - as I had hoped!

### Code
Contained in this repository (https://github.com/AidanGM/UdacityDSProject1.git) is the data file, and notebook analysing this data.

Files Provided:
- README.md: Short description of the project
- Boston_abnb.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the dataset analysis
- listings.csv: Raw data file containing Boston Airbnb data

Libraries used:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

### Key Findings

The most expensive neighbourhoods add nearly $100 to the average nightly price of $171, the top three being the Financial District (+$96), Downtown Crossing (+$79) and the Leather District (+$61). Some of the cheaper neighbourhoods could save potential guests around $40. Hosts can use this to decide a nightly price, and guests can decide which neighbourhoods best fit their budget.

The analysis also suggests that hosts should also consider investing in more amenities if they do not yet have them, this includes a washer/dryer, wireless internet, a TV, air conditioning, laptop-friendly workspace, and bathroom appliances. Also, consider carefully whether to have their pets in the Airbnb, there is some (limited) evidence that guests like dogs but other pets less so.

Other than the neighbourhood and amenities, few features largely affect nightly price. An obvious one is the capacity, number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Hosts may want to consider their selection process, response time and superhost status but this should be done with a grain of salt.

### Blog

The work contained was largely assisted by previous work done in the Udacity Nanodegree, as well as research on Stack Overflow.
